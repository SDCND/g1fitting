Clothoid generation and sampling library, with Python wrapper

The library was originally written by:
  Enrico Bertolazzi
  Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale
  Universita` degli Studi di Trento
  email: enrico.bertolazzi@unitn.it

An excellent MATLAB version of this, with many more features, exists on the MATLAB File Exchange

I've ported his MATLAB sampling function back to C++ and added a Python 2.7 wrapper for `Clothoid::buildClothoid` and `Clothoid::pointsOnClothoid`
